<div style="font-family: monospace; color: #a0a0a0;">
All your rhyme histories combined couldn't violate<br>
The prime Optimus operative, use my hydrometer<br>
To see how warm you are, watch me form a star<br>
Hydrogen turned to helium when I shine<br>
Riding 'em revealing 'em leading 'em to the vacuum<br>
Interact with tunes in my digital citadel<br>
Critical pivotal with the mental shit on you<br>
Spit infinity hidden energies too dope<br>
For our planet, star spanning slamming hymns<br>
With mechanical limbs, scanning your lens<br>
With cosmic rays, you'll all get played, your brain's inferior<br>
I hit the lateral and posterior
